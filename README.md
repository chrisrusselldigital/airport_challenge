Airport Challenge
=================

Before starting, having upgraded my ruby via rvm to 2.5.0, I then needed to re-install rspec and subsequently rubocop. This would only work using sudo.

I also lifted the requirements into a separate document, listing user stories (struck through when complete), as well as additional instructions of things that needed doing.

1) Created the airport & plane classes as well as accompanying test files: "filename_spec.rb"
2) Used the boris bike challenge as a basis for the idea of "airport" and "plane", as well as "landing" (docking) and "taking off" (release)
3) Done a bit of reading about "context" for tests as a way to logically separate "describe" from the individual methods
4)
